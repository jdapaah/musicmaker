# Music Maker

TJHSST Senior Research Project by Jeremy Dapaah. This project takes advantage of the [magenta-js](https://github.com/magenta/magenta-js) library to use machine learning to create music.
All you need to do is pick a file to upload, or a preexisting one, select some options, and watch your music come to life. This is the **Music Maker!**

This site was also live on [heroku](https://magenta-music.herokuapp.com)
